# conversions
This is a Java code assessment for a Team Lead Opportunity with an unknown company

## The Brief
Write a service that will provide the following conversion:
* Kelvin to celsius
* Pounds to kilograms
* Miles to kilometers

Undertake the task as you normally would when doing development

Time given: 1 hour

### My Process

#### Personal Notes
It's easy to dismiss the 'problem' as trivial, it is afterall a matter of simple arithmetic and therefore really easy to kncok together in under 20 minutes. In an hour most developers could do it in Java, C#, Python and possibly even Ruby to show off in true polyglot fashion, the kicker is that last paragraph **"Undertake the task as you normally would when doing development"**
In my experience this means forget the brief, concentrate on proper architecture, Layering, Microservice Architecture A la Martin Fowler, Jeffrey Palermo's Onion Architecture or Alistair Cockburn's Hexagon, it means serious consideration to InfoSec and Identity Management, IoC / Dependency Injection, Test Suites and ultimately an over-engineered, Enterprise grade solution to the problem of 'simple arithmetic'.

I find this whole unspoken expectation nothing less than offensive. We are adults (mostly), surely we can say what we mean. I respect transparency, I offer 100% transparency, disclosure and accountability which is why AGILE and SCRUM methodologies appeal to me. Back to the issue at hand, that final phrase in the brief poisons the well and leads me to question the integrity/honesty of the person who wrote it. They spent all of 60 seconds cooking up a simple problem, framed it with a time limit and dropped the most terse, obtuse hint that I should spend my billable hours on something they threw together in under a minute.
